# CtfTickets Elixir

Support for Nautilus Institute CTF Tickets and receipts.
Should be compatible with the Ruby version.

## Installation

Right now this isn't available in Hex,
so what you really want to do is grab the artifact out of
GitHub Actions.

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/ctf_tickets>.
